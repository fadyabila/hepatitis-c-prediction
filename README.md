# Hepatitis C Prediction
The purpose of this data classification analysis and modeling is to find out what the diagnoses are in patients so that they receive further treatment, can be cured, and minimize death. This modeling uses 4 Machine Learning (Supervised) algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to get the best predictions with hyperparameter tuning.
